> Note: This module supports Sitecore 9.0+. 
> * For Sitecore 8.1+ please see [here](https://github.com/onenorth/express-subitem/tree/sitecore-8.1).
> * For Sitecore 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, or 7.5 please see [here](https://github.com/onenorth/express-subitem/tree/sitecore-7.0).

## Overview

The Express Subitem Module allows content editors to edit multiple child Sitecore items at the same time within the context of the parent item. This field is commonly used to manage lists of related items that exist only within the context of the parent.  A few examples are as follows:

 1. Addresses related to a Person
 2. Education History related to a Person
 3. Employment History related to a Person
 3. Schedule related to an Event

This field improves the content editing experience because the content administrator does not need to navigate to the child items to edit related information.

All child items managed by this field are stored in subfolders under the parent.
The subfolders are hidden from user roles to prevent clutter in the content tree.
Users are unable to edit the child items directly in favor of editing them through the Express Subitem control.
Administrators are able to view the subfolders and edit the child items directly if needed.

    </configuration>

### Field Configuration

To create an Express Subitem field in a template, you must set the field type column to "Express Subitem" in the template builder. 

The Source entry contains two parameters, **template** and **name**. These parameters are entered much like a http query string. An example of a source parameter for an express subitem field looks like:

    template=/sitecore/templates/Legal/Content/Entities/Professionals/Education&name={School}, {Year}

The **template** is the path of the sub-item template. This template must exist.

The **name** specifies the format of the created sub-items name. The values in braces '{}' are field names on the sub-item and are used to determine the name. If the value of one of these field changes, the name of the sub-item will be updated.
